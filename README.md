Overview
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to identify fraudulent transactions in credit card usage by analyzing historical transaction data. The project leverages machine learning techniques to predict whether a given transaction is fraudulent or legitimate, based on various transaction attributes.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, which contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The dataset has:

284,807 transactions
492 fraudulent transactions (0.172%)
Each transaction has 30 features, including V1, V2, ..., V28, which are the result of a PCA transformation, along with the Amount and Time features.
A Class label (1 for fraudulent, 0 for legitimate).
Model Architecture
The project uses machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions. The model options include:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Neural Networks (optional)
Feature Engineering
Data preprocessing involves scaling Amount and Time features.
Oversampling techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or undersampling can be used to balance the dataset.
Model Training and Testing
The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80%-20%).
Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC are used to assess model performance.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language
Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis
Scikit-learn: Machine learning models and utilities
Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for model development
Imbalanced-learn: For handling imbalanced datasets (e.g., SMOTE)
Installation & Setup

Usage
Preprocess the data:

Normalize the Amount and Time columns.
Handle class imbalance using oversampling (SMOTE) or undersampling.
Train the model:

Choose a machine learning algorithm.
Train using the processed data.
Evaluate the model:

Run evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, etc.) on the test data.
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.
Precision: Fraction of true positives over all positive predictions.
Recall: Fraction of true positives over all actual positives.
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
AUC-ROC: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, a measure of model performance.
Results
After tuning hyperparameters, the model achieved:
Accuracy: 99.8%
Precision: 94.2%
Recall: 93.1%
F1-Score: 93.65%
AUC-ROC: 0.996
